In the gathering & pre-processing phase, we implemented a computer program written in c# that extracts paragraphs from Wikipedia articles in a proper format as raw data.</br>
Then, we continued to pre-process the raw data by removing the stopwords, lemmatizing, creating the bag of words, etc. We did this part using python programming language on the Google Collab platform.</br>
Finally, we used the prepared data to train & test several machine learning & deep learning models. We also did this phase utilizing python programming language on the Google Colab platform.</br>
